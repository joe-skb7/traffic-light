LED driver calculation
======================


LED voltage drop:

    V_LED = 2 V

LED nominal current:

    I_LED = 20 mA

LED count (per one driver):

    n_LED = 5

Total load current (because LEDs are connected in series):

    I_Load = I_LED = 20 mA

Min. driver voltage must be:

    Vcc_min = n_LED * V_LED = 10 V

Let's take driver voltage:

    Vcc = 12 V

Let's use BC547 transistor (choosen by current, voltage and hFE params).
Next data was obtained from BC547 datasheet.

We will use controlling voltage:

    V_ctrl = 5 V

Driver's Q1 collector current:

    I_c = I_Load = 20 mA

Transistor Q1 opens when:

    V_BE = 0.75 V

Sense resistor resistance must be (because LEDs connected in series, not in
parallel):

    R1 = V_BE / I_LED = 0.75 / 0.02 = 37.5 Ohm = 39 Ohm   // by E24

Minimal hFE (worst case gain), for BC547A:

    hFE = 110

Base current must be:

    I_b = I_c / hFE = 0.02 / 110 = 0.182 mA = 0.3 mA  // to have a safety margin

Then R2 resistance:

    R2 = (V_ctrl - V_BE - V_R1) / I_b = 11.667 kOhm = 10 kOhm  // E24
